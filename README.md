# Temperature-convertor
A temperature converter is a tool or program that converts temperature values between different units such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It uses standard formulas like °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32 or K = °C + 273.15 to accurately transform one unit into another, making it useful in science, travel, and daily life.
